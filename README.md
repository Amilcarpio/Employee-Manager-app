## My process

I tried to create a simple, but efficient, system, that could manipulate the data and create new users with authentication.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Vue.js
- Firebase

### What I learned

That wasn't a easy project for me, but i'm very proud for the result. I learn a lot how to manipulate data with javascript promises, create routes and guards, also how to validate the system.
